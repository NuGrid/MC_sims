*** HOW TO PREPARE AND RUN MC SIMULATIONS FOR A REACTION-RATE UNCERTAINTY STUDY
***

1. Prepare a list (the text file "reaction_factors.txt") of isotopes whose (n,g) cross sections are 
   to be varied with their maximum variation factors in the last columns in the following format:

   SR 93  10.0
   Y  90   5.0
   Y  92  10.0
   ZR 99   5.0
   ZR100  10.0
    
   (n,g) reactions can easily be replaced with other reactions, e.g. (p,g), etc.

2. The fortran program "prep_mc_network.f"
   uses this list to generate a large number (say, "nmc=10000") of "networksetup_imc.txt" files, 
   where "imc=1,nmc", with randomly selected multiplication factors for the listed reaction rates 
   from a "template_networksetup.txt" file that is used in the benchmark model.

   Don't forget to copy template_networksetup.txt to networksetup_0.txt AFTERWARDS!

   This program also generates text file "reaction_factors_mult.txt"
   that contains arrays of the applied variation factors 
   for each of the MC runs.

3. Run the shell script onezone_MC_sims.sh that cycles over "imc=1,nmc" to copy the generated 
   "networksetup_imc.txt" files one after another to your ppn run directory and starts the runs.

   The file ppn_physics.input must have ININET=3, so that ppn.exe uses the current file networksetup.txt.
   
   Check the content of onezone_MC_sims.sh to see if the names of the run and result directories are correct.

4. Then use a jupyter notebook to read the MC simulation data and analyze them.
